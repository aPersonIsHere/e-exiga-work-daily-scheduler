# e-exiga-js-fundamentals-quiz
The Git Repository for Emmanuel Exiga's Work Daily Scheduler.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to challenge my knowledge in JavaScript (with the inclusion of jQuery and Day.js), CSS, and HTML to create a work daily scheduler. The program auto-generates upon loading the saved information in local storage. From the hours 9am-5pm, the user is able to put hourly memos for their day.
